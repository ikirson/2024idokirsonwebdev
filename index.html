  <h1>Ido's HTML 1 Lab</h1>
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>My name is Ido Kirson. I am from Cambridge, Massachusetts; I have lived here my whole life. I went to Graham & Parks for elementary school, VLUS for middle school, and now I go to CRLS</p>
  <p>As for my hobbies, I like to be outdoors. Sometimes I bike, sometimes I hike, and sometimes I ski. I like to bike westward to towns like Lincoln and Weston, and hike + ski in New Hampshire.</p>
  <h3>Career Aspirations</h3>
  <p>I would like to pursure a career in math/statistics. I want to go to Williams College and study one of those two. CS 2 should help me because statistics is very programming heavy, and I will need to work on my coding skills. I wouldn't mind being on the data science side of statistics, as I am intrigued by the AI revolution.</p>
